ðŸ§¾  License BshBin development of experiments 

I hereby allow anyone interested to modify and use the source code of the BshBin product without having to credit the author (in this case, me). However, in exchange for this freedom, I require that all users of this code get involved in the development of the BshBin project and help it spread its wings. In practice, this means that if you modify or use the BshBin code, you must include the name "BshBin" prominently in your project or mention BshBin in the description, documentation or other appropriate places. In addition, I encourage everyone who uses the BshBin code to collaborate with the BshBin community by submitting their changes, fixes and providing support to further develop this project. It is this commitment and cooperation that are crucial for BshBin's success and continued development. Remember that the BshBin Grow Your Wings license does not apply to external resources, libraries or other elements used in the BshBin project. It only includes the source code of BshBin itself. And anything you write in BshBin may be subject to your copyright. I wish you fruitful work and I am glad that we can contribute to the development of BshBin together!
